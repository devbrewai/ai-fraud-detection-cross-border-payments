# Phase 3: Sanctions Screening Module Findings

**Status:** Not Started  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01

## Overview

This document will capture all technical findings, performance metrics, and design decisions from Phase 3 of the sanctions screening module implementation.

## Planned Scope

### OFAC Data Integration
- SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list processing
- Consolidated sanctions list processing
- Entity name standardization and preprocessing

### Fuzzy Matching Implementation
- RapidFuzz algorithm selection and configuration
- Confidence score calibration
- Country and date filter optimization

### Performance Benchmarking
- Matching latency profiling
- Throughput optimization
- Caching strategy evaluation

## Key Objectives

- [ ] Fuzzy matching accuracy â‰¥95% on test cases
- [ ] Matching latency <50ms p95
- [ ] Confidence score correlation with manual review decisions
- [ ] Integration with fraud detection pipeline

## Evaluation Criteria

**Technical Metrics:**
- Match precision and recall on labeled test set
- False positive rate at various confidence thresholds
- Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Memory footprint

**Business Metrics:**
- Manual review reduction vs baseline rule-based system
- Compliance coverage (% of sanctioned entities detectable)
- Alert quality (precision of high-confidence matches)

**Note:** This document will be populated with findings as Phase 3 progresses. See [roadmap.md](../roadmap.md) for current project status.
