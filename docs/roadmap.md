## Phase 1: Data Preparation & Exploration

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Complete

### Tasks

- [x] Set up project structure and environment
- [x] Download all required datasets (IEEE-CIS, PaySim, OFAC)
- [x] Create data availability validation script
- [x] Build helper functions for data loading and quality analysis
- [x] Perform initial EDA on IEEE-CIS train data
- [x] Analyze PaySim dataset
- [x] Analyze OFAC sanctions lists (SDN + Consolidated)
- [x] Define missing value handling strategy (>90% missing columns)
- [x] Engineer fraud detection features:
  - [x] Velocity counters (transactions per user 1h/24h)
  - [x] Device reuse patterns
  - [x] BIN-IP mismatch detection
  - [x] Amount z-scores per merchant
- [x] Merge and prepare final training dataset
- [x] Save processed features to disk

**Success Criteria:**

- [x] All datasets loaded and validated
- [x] Data quality issues documented
- [x] Feature engineering complete
- [x] Clean dataset ready for model training

**Key Findings:**

- IEEE-CIS: 590K rows, 394 columns, 3.5% fraud rate (1:29 imbalance)
- 374/394 columns have missing values (some >90%)
- No duplicate rows
- **Development Best Practice**: Built reusable helper functions with validation tests during exploration phase. These tests verify data loading, quality analysis, and visualization functions work correctly before production use. Post-development, verbose tests will be replaced with minimal validation for clean, production-ready notebooks while maintaining safety checks

**Cross-Dataset Insights:**

- **Class Imbalance**: Both IEEE-CIS (1:37) and PaySim (1:500) are highly imbalanced; stratified sampling and proper CV are mandatory
- **Feature Coverage**: IEEE-CIS has 434 features enabling richer modeling; PaySim has 11 features but includes explicit transaction types useful for rule-based features
- **Compliance Integration**: OFAC sanctions data (39,350 entities) preprocessed and ready for fuzzy matching pipeline integration
- **Modeling Strategy**: Side-by-side metrics reveal algorithm choice and tuning must account for different imbalance ratios and feature availability
- **Deployment Planning**: Conditional logic implemented to handle missing/unloaded datasets gracefully during analysis

**Feature Engineering Insights:**

- **Missing Value Strategy**: Dropped 12 columns (3% of features) with >90% missing values; imputed remaining using median (numeric) and mode (categorical) strategies, achieving 0 missing values in final dataset
- **Single-Transaction Edge Case**: 3,444 cards (0.58%) appeared only once in dataset, causing NaN in standard deviation calculations; resolved by filling with 0 (semantically correct: no variation for single transactions)
- **Feature Density**: Engineered 10 high-value features (time-based, velocity, device reuse, amount statistics) increasing feature count from 422 to 432 while reducing memory footprint from 66MB to 59MB through optimized data types
- **Velocity Computation**: Card-level velocity features (1h/24h windows) are computationally expensive on 590K transactions; consider pre-computation or sampling strategies for larger datasets or real-time inference
- **Data Quality Validation**: Post-processing validation critical, automated checks caught missing values in engineered features before model training, preventing downstream failures
- **Production Considerations**: Device and card aggregation features require maintaining state in production; velocity features need Redis/cache layer; amount statistics benefit from periodic recomputation as new transactions arrive

## Phase 2: Fraud Model Training

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

### Tasks

- [x] Split data (train/validation/test)
- [x] Handle class imbalance (class weights)
- [x] Train baseline model (LightGBM/XGBoost)
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning (Step 7)
- [x] Evaluate model performance:
  - [x] ROC-AUC â‰¥ 0.85 (target)
  - [x] PR-AUC â‰¥ 0.35 (target)
  - [x] Confusion matrix analysis (3 thresholds)
  - [x] Precision-Recall-Threshold curves
  - [x] Cost-sensitive threshold optimization
  - [x] Feature importance analysis
  - [x] Comprehensive evaluation JSON
- [ ] Calibrate probabilities (isotonic regression) (Step 8)
- [ ] Implement SHAP explainability (Step 9)
- [x] Save model artifacts (baseline + evaluation)
- [x] Document model performance and limitations

**Success Criteria:**

- [x] ROC-AUC â‰¥ 0.85 on test set
- [x] PR-AUC â‰¥ 0.35 on test set
- [ ] Model explainability implemented
- [x] Model artifacts saved and versioned
- [x] Evaluation metrics documented

**Key Findings:**

- **Baseline Model Performance**: LightGBM baseline achieves test ROC-AUC of 0.8861 (exceeds 0.85 target), training in 8.35 seconds with early stopping at 295 iterations
- **Temporal Drift Impact**: PR-AUC shows significant degradation from train (0.7673) to test (0.4743), attributed to documented temporal drift in fraud patterns (0.52pp fraud rate shift) and conservative baseline hyperparameters
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: is_unbalance parameter with 28.56x positive class weighting effectively addresses 1:29 fraud-legitimate imbalance, though PR-AUC performance indicates room for improvement through hyperparameter tuning
- **Model Generalization**: Train-validation gap of 5.59% indicates acceptable overfitting levels for baseline; test PR-AUC (0.4743) remains 13.9x better than random classifier (0.0344), validating pipeline correctness
- **Feature Importance Concentration**: Top 20 features (4.7% of feature set) explain 73.4% of model importance; 315 features (73.4%) needed for 90% importance coverage, indicating significant feature redundancy and opportunity for dimensionality reduction
- **V-Feature Dominance**: Anonymous V-features (V257, V258, V294, V283, V317) dominate top-10 importance, suggesting IEEE-CIS engineered features capture critical fraud signals; transaction amount (TransactionAmt) ranks as top interpretable feature
- **Production Readiness**: Baseline establishes reference point for hyperparameter tuning; PR-AUC improvement is primary optimization target while maintaining ROC-AUC performance and monitoring for overfitting
- **Categorical Feature Handling**: Successfully converted and trained on 29 high-cardinality categorical features (email domains, device info, card identifiers) - critical fraud signals that triggered expected LightGBM warnings for bins exceeding max_bin threshold
- **Model Artifacts**: Comprehensive metadata structure with 13 sections (compliance, explainability, limitations, monitoring) demonstrates production-grade MLOps practices; model size 1.18 MB enables low-latency inference
- **Comprehensive Evaluation (Step 6)**: Implemented production-grade evaluation with threshold-independent metrics (ROC-AUC: 0.8861, PR-AUC: 0.4743), confusion matrix analysis at 3 operationally relevant thresholds, and precision-recall curves across full probability spectrum
- **Cost-Sensitive Optimization**: Business-aligned threshold optimization (FP cost: $5, FN cost: $100) identifies threshold 0.4205 achieving **$225,625 cost savings** (55.5% reduction) while maintaining 70.7% fraud capture at 12.9% review rate
- **Multi-Threshold Analysis**: Evaluated 3 operating points - fraud-rate-aligned (98.2% recall, 4.1% precision), default 0.5 (55.7% recall, 17.6% precision), and optimal F1 0.8440 (35.8% recall, 64.8% precision) - demonstrating precision-recall trade-offs for stakeholder decision-making
- **Production Deployment Readiness**: Comprehensive evaluation JSON includes monitoring guidelines (Â±5% flagged rate tolerance), alerting thresholds (min ROC-AUC: 0.82, min recall: 0.637), and quarterly re-evaluation triggers for temporal drift detection
- **Evaluation Artifacts**: Generated 3 high-resolution visualizations (confusion matrices, cost optimization curves, precision-recall curves) and structured JSON metadata enabling MLOps integration, regulatory audits, and baseline-vs-tuned model comparison
- **Business Value Quantification**: At cost-optimal threshold, model processes 12.9% of transactions (15,250 reviews) to catch 70.7% of fraud (2,875 cases), with expected cost per transaction reduced from $3.44 (no model) to $1.53 (with model)
