## Phase 1: Data Preparation & Exploration

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

### Tasks

- [x] Set up project structure and environment
- [x] Download all required datasets (IEEE-CIS, PaySim, OFAC)
- [x] Create data availability validation script
- [x] Build helper functions for data loading and quality analysis
- [x] Perform initial EDA on IEEE-CIS train data
- [x] Analyze PaySim dataset
- [ ] Analyze OFAC sanctions lists (SDN + Consolidated)
- [ ] Define missing value handling strategy (>90% missing columns)
- [ ] Engineer fraud detection features:
  - [ ] Velocity counters (transactions per user 1h/24h)
  - [ ] Device reuse patterns
  - [ ] BIN-IP mismatch detection
  - [ ] Amount z-scores per merchant
- [ ] Merge and prepare final training dataset
- [ ] Save processed features to disk

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] All datasets loaded and validated
- [ ] Data quality issues documented
- [ ] Feature engineering complete
- [ ] Clean dataset ready for model training

**Key Findings:**

- IEEE-CIS: 590K rows, 394 columns, 3.5% fraud rate (1:29 imbalance)
- 374/394 columns have missing values (some >90%)
- No duplicate rows
- **Development Best Practice**: Built reusable helper functions with validation tests during exploration phase. These tests verify data loading, quality analysis, and visualization functions work correctly before production use. Post-development, verbose tests will be replaced with minimal validation for clean, production-ready notebooks while maintaining safety checks

- [ ] Evaluate model performance:
  - [ ] ROC-AUC â‰¥ 0.85 (target)
  - [ ] PR-AUC
  - [ ] Confusion matrix
  - [ ] Feature importance analysis
- [ ] Calibrate probabilities (isotonic regression)
- [ ] Implement SHAP explainability
- [ ] Save model artifacts
